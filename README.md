##ZXing Introduction

ZXing ("Zebra Crossing")

ZXing (pronounced "zebra crossing") is an open-source, multi-format 1D/2D barcode image processing library implemented in Java, with ports to other languages. Our focus is on using the built-in camera on mobile phones to scan and decode barcodes on the device, without communicating with a server. However the project can be used to encode and decode barcodes on desktops and servers as well. We currently support these formats:

* UPC-A and UPC-E
* EAN-8 and EAN-13
* Code 39
* Code 93
* Code 128
* ITF
* Codabar
* RSS-14 (all variants)
* RSS Expanded (most variants)
* QR Code
* Data Matrix
* Aztec ('beta' quality)
* PDF 417 ('alpha' quality)
