ZXing ("Zebra Crossing")
ZXing (pronounced "zebra crossing") is an open-source, multi-format 1D/2D barcode image processing library implemented in Java, with ports to other languages. Our focus is on using the built-in camera on mobile phones to scan and decode barcodes on the device, without communicating with a server. However the project can be used to encode and decode barcodes on desktops and servers as well. We currently support these formats:

*UPC-A and UPC-E
*EAN-8 and EAN-13
*Code 39
*Code 93
*Code 128
*ITF
*Codabar
*RSS-14 (all variants)
*RSS Expanded (most variants)
*QR Code
*Data Matrix
*Aztec ('beta' quality)
*PDF 417 ('alpha' quality)
